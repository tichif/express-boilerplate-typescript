# Express boilerplate with Typescript

This is an Express boilerplate with Typescript and :
- Mongoose
- Zod
- Pino
- Redis
- Argon2
- Lodash
- Helmet
- etc

First you should install all dependencies with Yarn or Npm:
```npm
yarn install
```

To run the server
```npm 
yarn run dev
```

To build the server
```npm
yarn run build
```

I will always update the dependencies and add features. You can use for your project.
